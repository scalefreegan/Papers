Here, we present a comparative analysis of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on high-quality draft sequences of three related species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus). We first aligned the genomes and characterized their evolution, defining the regions and mechanisms of change. We then developed methods for direct identification of genes and regulatory motifs. The gene analysis yielded a major revision to the yeast gene catalogue, affecting approximately 15\% of all genes and reducing the total count by about 500 genes. The motif analysis automatically identified 72 genome-wide elements, including most known regulatory motifs and numerous new motifs. We inferred a putative function for most of these motifs, and provided insights into their combinatorial interactions. The results have implications for genome analysis of diverse organisms, including the human.},

Here, we present the first predictive model of global gene regulation of methanogenesis in a hydrogenotrophic methanogen, Methanococcus maripaludis. We generated a comprehensive list of genes (protein-coding and noncoding) for M. maripaludis through integrated analysis of the transcriptome structure and a newly constructed Peptide Atlas. The environment and gene-regulatory influence network ({EGRIN)} model of the strain was constructed from a compendium of transcriptome data that was collected over 58 different steady-state and time-course experiments that were performed in chemostats or batch cultures under a spectrum of environmental perturbations that modulated methanogenesis. Analyses of the {EGRIN} model have revealed novel components of methanogenesis that included at least three additional protein-coding genes of previously unknown function as well as one noncoding {RNA.} We discovered that at least five regulatory mechanisms act in a combinatorial scheme to intercoordinate key steps of methanogenesis with different processes such as motility, {ATP} biosynthesis, and carbon assimilation. Through a combination of genetic and environmental perturbation experiments we have validated the {EGRIN-predicted} role of two novel transcription factors in the regulation of phosphate-dependent repression of formate dehydrogenase-a key enzyme in the methanogenesis pathway. The {EGRIN} model demonstrates regulatory affiliations within methanogenesis as well as between methanogenesis and other cellular functions.},

	abstract = {Attribution of biological robustness to the specific structural properties of a regulatory network is an important yet unsolved problem in systems biology. It is widely believed that the topological characteristics of a biological control network largely determine its dynamic behavior, yet the actual mechanism is still poorly understood. Here, we define a novel structural feature of biological networks, termed 'regulation entropy', to quantitatively assess the influence of network topology on the robustness of the systems. Using the cell-cycle control networks of the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) as examples, we first demonstrate the correlation of this quantity with the dynamic stability of biological control networks, and then we establish a significant association between this quantity and the structural stability of the networks. And we further substantiate the generality of this approach with a broad spectrum of biological and random networks. We conclude that the regulation entropy is an effective order parameter in evaluating the robustness of biological control networks. Our work suggests a novel connection between the topological feature and the dynamic property of biological regulatory networks.},

	abstract = {A myriad of methods to reverse-engineer transcriptional regulatory networks have been developed in recent years. Direct methods directly reconstruct a network of pairwise regulatory interactions while module-based methods predict a set of regulators for modules of coexpressed genes treated as a single unit. To date, there has been no systematic comparison of the relative strengths and weaknesses of both types of {methods.We} have compared a recently developed module-based algorithm, {LeMoNe} (Learning Module Networks), to a mutual information based direct algorithm, {CLR} (Context Likelihood of Relatedness), using benchmark expression data and databases of known transcriptional regulatory interactions for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A global comparison using recall versus precision curves hides the topologically distinct nature of the inferred networks and is not informative about the specific subtasks for which each method is most suited. Analysis of the degree distributions and a regulator specific comparison show that {CLR} is 'regulator-centric', making true predictions for a higher number of regulators, while {LeMoNe} is 'target-centric', recovering a higher number of known targets for fewer regulators, with limited overlap in the predicted interactions between both methods. Detailed biological examples in E. coli and S. cerevisiae are used to illustrate these differences and to prove that each method is able to infer parts of the network where the other fails. Biological validation of the inferred networks cautions against over-interpreting recall and precision values computed using incomplete reference {networks.Our} results indicate that module-based and direct methods retrieve largely distinct parts of the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks. The choice of algorithm should therefore be based on the particular biological problem of interest and not on global metrics which cannot be transferred between organisms. The development of sound statistical methods for integrating the predictions of different reverse-engineering strategies emerges as an important challenge for future research.},

	abstract = {Assembly of genes into operons is generally viewed as an important process during the continual adaptation of microbes to changing environmental challenges. However, the genome reorganization events that drive this process are also the roots of instability for existing operons. We have determined that there exists a statistically significant trend that correlates the proportion of genes encoded in operons in archaea to their phylogenetic lineage. We have further characterized how microbes deal with operon instability by mapping and comparing transcriptome architectures of four phylogenetically diverse extremophiles that span the range of operon stabilities observed across archaeal lineages: a photoheterotrophic halophile (Halobacterium salinarum {NRC-1)}, a hydrogenotrophic methanogen (Methanococcus maripaludis S2), an acidophilic and aerobic thermophile (Sulfolobus solfataricus P2), and an anaerobic hyperthermophile (Pyrococcus furiosus {DSM} 3638). We demonstrate how the evolution of transcriptional elements (promoters and terminators) generates new operons, restores the coordinated regulation of translocated, inverted, and newly acquired genes, and introduces completely novel regulation for even some of the most conserved operonic genes such as those encoding subunits of the ribosome. The inverse correlation (r=-0.92) between the proportion of operons with such internally located transcriptional elements and the fraction of conserved operons in each of the four archaea reveals an unprecedented view into varying stages of operon evolution. Importantly, our integrated analysis has revealed that organisms adapted to higher growth temperatures have lower tolerance for genome reorganization events that disrupt operon structures.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0001700},
	abstract = {Memory is usually associated with higher organisms rather than bacteria. However, evidence is mounting that many regulatory networks within bacteria are capable of complex dynamics and multi-stable behaviors that have been linked to memory in other systems. Moreover, it is recognized that bacteria that have experienced different environmental histories may respond differently to current conditions. These "memory” effects may be more than incidental to the regulatory mechanisms controlling acclimation or to the status of the metabolic stores. Rather, they may be regulated by the cell and confer fitness to the organism in the evolutionary game it participates in. Here, we propose that history-dependent behavior is a potentially important manifestation of memory, worth classifying and quantifying. To this end, we develop an information-theory based conceptual framework for measuring both the persistence of memory in microbes and the amount of information about the past encoded in history-dependent dynamics. This method produces a phenomenological measure of cellular memory without regard to the specific cellular mechanisms encoding it. We then apply this framework to a strain of Bacillus subtilis engineered to report on commitment to sporulation and degradative enzyme ({AprE)} synthesis and estimate the capacity of these systems and growth dynamics to 'remember' 10 distinct cell histories prior to application of a common stressor. The analysis suggests that B. subtilis remembers, both in short and long term, aspects of its cell history, and that this memory is distributed differently among the observables. While this study does not examine the mechanistic bases for memory, it presents a framework for quantifying memory in cellular behaviors and is thus a starting point for studying new questions about cellular regulation and evolutionary strategy.},

	abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments(1,2). However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales(3). Although in vitro and directed evolution methods(4-9) have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering ({MAGE)} for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. {MAGE} simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the {MAGE} technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied {MAGE} to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate ({DXP)} biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the {DXP} pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic {DNA}, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

Previous studies have shown that the genes coding for the {KdpFABC} complex are arranged in a {kdpFABCQ} gene cluster together with an additional gene {kdpQ.} In bacteria, expression of the {kdpFABC} genes is generally regulated by the dedicated sensor kinase/response regulator pair {KdpD/KdpE}, which are absent in H. salinarum. Surprisingly, H. salinarum expresses the kdp genes in a manner which is strikingly similar to Escherichia coli. In this study, we show that the halobacterial {kdpFABCQ} genes constitute an operon and that {kdpFABCQ} expression is subject to a complex regulatory mechanism involving a negative transcriptional regulator and is further modulated via a so far unknown mechanism. We describe how the regulation of kdp gene expression is facilitated in H. salinarum in contrast to its bacterial counterparts. Whereas the Kdp system fulfils the same core function as an {ATP-driven} K(+) uptake system in both archaea and bacteria, the different mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression appear to have evolved separately, possibly reflecting a different physiological role of {ATP-driven} K(+) uptake in halophilic archaea.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions between two proteins have generally been studied using biochemical techniques such as crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation and co-fractionation by chromatography. We have generated a novel genetic system to study these interactions by taking advantage of the properties of the {GAL4} protein of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This protein is a transcriptional activator required for the expression of genes encoding enzymes of galactose utilization. It consists of two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain which binds to specific {DNA} sequences ({UASG);} and a C-terminal domain containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription. We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts of {GAL4:} the {GAL4} {DNA-binding} domain fused to a protein {'X'} and a {GAL4} activating region fused to a protein {'Y'.} If X and Y can form a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the {GAL4} domains, transcription of a gene regulated by {UASG} occurs. We have tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to {interact–SNF1} and {SNF4.} High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein by the use of a simple galactose selection.},

Here we present an integrated analysis of 1,975 published microarrays spanning 22 tumor types. We describe expression profiles in different tumors in terms of the behavior of modules, sets of genes that act in concert to carry out a specific function. Using a simple unified analysis, we extract modules and characterize gene-expression profiles in tumors as a combination of activated and deactivated modules. Activation of some modules is specific to particular types of tumor; for example, a growth-inhibitory module is specifically repressed in acute lymphoblastic leukemias and may underlie the deregulated proliferation in these cancers. Other modules are shared across a diverse set of clinical conditions, suggestive of common tumor progression mechanisms. For example, the bone osteoblastic module spans a variety of tumor types and includes both secreted growth factors and their receptors. Our findings suggest that there is a single mechanism for both primary tumor proliferation and metastasis to bone. Our analysis presents multiple research directions for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic studies.},

	abstract = {Adaptation of bacteria to new or changing environments is often associated with the uptake of foreign genes through horizontal gene transfer. However, it has remained unclear how (and how fast) new genes are integrated into their host's cellular networks. Combining the regulatory and protein interaction networks of Escherichia coli with comparative genomics tools, we provide the first systematic analysis of this issue. Genes transferred recently have fewer interaction partners compared to nontransferred genes in both regulatory and protein interaction networks. Thus, horizontally transferred genes involved in complex regulatory and protein-protein interactions are rarely favored by selection. Only few protein-protein interactions are gained after the initial integration of genes following the transfer event. In contrast, transferred genes are gradually integrated into the regulatory network of their host over evolutionary time. During adaptation to the host cellular environment, horizontally transferred genes recruit existing transcription factors of the host, reflected in the fast evolutionary rates of the cis-regulatory regions of transferred genes. Further, genes resulting from increasingly ancient transfer events show increasing numbers of transcriptional regulators as well as improved coregulation with interacting proteins. Fine-tuned integration of horizontally transferred genes into the regulatory network spans more than 8-22 million years and encompasses accelerated evolution of regulatory regions, stabilization of protein-protein interactions, and changes in codon usage.},

The periplasmic dipeptide-binding protein ({DBP)}, encoded by the {dppA} gene, also serves as a chemoreceptor. We sequenced the dpp locus, which comprises an operon of five genes, {dppABCDE.} Its organization is the same as the oligopeptide permease (opp) operon of Salmonella typhimurium and the {spo0K} operon of Bacillus subtilis. The dpp genes are also closely related to the {hbpA} gene, which encodes a haem-binding lipoprotein, and four other genes in an unlinked operon of unknown function in Haemophilus influenzae. Each Dpp protein has an Opp, {Spo0K} and H. influenzae homologue. Transcription of the dpp operon initiates 165 bases upstream of the predicted {dppA} start codon. The start site for transcription is preceded by potential -35 and -10 regions of a sigma 70 promoter. During exponential growth in Luria-Bertani ({LB)} broth, the level of dpp {mRNA} increases in two steps, one between A590 0.2 and 0.4 and one between A590 0.7 and 1.0. The 310 nucleotides between {dppA} and {dppB} include a {RIP} (repetitive {IHF-binding} palindromic) element, whose deletion from a multi-copy plasmid causes fivefold and 10-fold reductions in the levels of upstream and downstream dpp {mRNA}, respectively.},

Gene duplication is the driving force for creating new genes in genomes: at least 50\% of prokaryotic genes(4,5) and over 90\% of eukaryotic genes(6) are products of gene duplication. The transcriptional interactions in regulatory networks consist of multiple components, and duplication processes that generate new interactions would need to be more complex. We define possible duplication scenarios and show that they formed the regulatory networks of the prokaryote Escherichia coli and the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Gene duplication has had a key role in network evolution: more than one-third of known regulatory interactions were inherited from the ancestral transcription factor or target gene after duplication, and roughly one-half of the interactions were gained during divergence after duplication. In addition, we conclude that evolution has been incremental, rather than making entire regulatory circuits or motifs by duplication with inheritance of interactions.},

	abstract = {Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.},

	abstract = {All living things are remarkably complex, yet their {DNA} is unstable, undergoing countless random mutations over generations. Despite this instability, most animals do not grow two heads or die, plants continue to thrive, and bacteria continue to divide. Robustness and Evolvability in Living Systems tackles this perplexing paradox. The book explores why genetic changes do not cause organisms to fail catastrophically and how evolution shapes organisms' robustness. Andreas Wagner looks at this problem from the ground up, starting with the alphabet of {DNA}, the genetic code, {RNA}, and protein molecules, moving on to genetic networks and embryonic development, and working his way up to whole organisms. He then develops an evolutionary explanation for robustness. Wagner shows how evolution by natural selection preferentially finds and favors robust solutions to the problems organisms face in surviving and reproducing. Such robustness, he argues, also enhances the potential for future evolutionary innovation. Wagner also argues that robustness has less to do with organisms having plenty of spare parts (the redundancy theory that has been popular) and more to do with the reality that mutations can change organisms in ways that do not substantively affect their fitness. Unparalleled in its field, this book offers the most detailed analysis available of all facets of robustness within organisms. It will appeal not only to biologists but also to engineers interested in the design of robust systems and to social scientists concerned with robustness in human communities and populations.},

Flies in these selected populations develop from egg to adult similar to 20\% faster than flies of ancestral control populations, and have evolved a number of other correlated phenotypes. On the basis of 688,520 intermediate-frequency, high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify several dozen genomic regions that show strong allele frequency differentiation between a pooled sample of five replicate populations selected for accelerated development and pooled controls. On the basis of resequencing data from a single replicate population with accelerated development, as well as single nucleotide polymorphism data from individual flies from each replicate population, we infer little allele frequency differentiation between replicate populations within a selection treatment. Signatures of selection are qualitatively different than what has been observed in asexual species; in our sexual populations, adaptation is not associated with 'classic' sweeps whereby newly arising, unconditionally advantageous mutations become fixed. More parsimonious explanations include 'incomplete' sweep models, in which mutations have not had enough time to fix, and 'soft' sweep models, in which selection acts on pre-existing, common genetic variants. We conclude that, at least for life history characters such as development time, unconditionally advantageous alleles rarely arise, are associated with small net fitness gains or cannot fix because selection coefficients change over time.},

Two intermediate types of population structure were also found. Neisseria meningitidis displays what we have called an ”epidemic” structure. There is significant association between loci, but this arises only because of the recent, explosive, increase in particular electrophoretic types; when this effect is eliminated the population is found to be effectively panmictic. In contrast, linkage disequilibrium in a population of Rhizobium meliloti exists because the sample consisted of two genetically isolated divisions, often fixed for different alleles: within each division association between loci was almost random. The method of analysis is appropriate whenever there is doubt about the extent of genetic recombination between members of a population. To illustrate this we analyzed data on protozoan parasites and again found panmictic, epidemic, and clonal population structures.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-10-11},
	abstract = {Background: Environmental conditions affect the topology of the adaptive landscape and thus the trajectories followed by evolving populations. For example, a heterogeneous environment might lead to a more rugged adaptive landscape, making it more likely that replicate populations would evolve toward distinct adaptive peaks, relative to a uniform environment. To date, the influence of environmental variability on evolutionary dynamics has received relatively little experimental study. Results: We report findings from an experiment designed to test the effects of environmental variability on the adaptation and divergence of replicate populations of E. coli. A total of 42 populations evolved for 2000 generations in 7 environmental regimes that differed in the number, identity, and presentation of the limiting resource. Regimes were organized in two sets, having the sugars glucose and maltose singly and in combination, or glucose and lactose singly and in combination. Combinations of sugars were presented either simultaneously or as temporally fluctuating resource regimes. This design allowed us to compare the effects of resource identity and presentation on the evolutionary trajectories followed by replicate populations. After 2000 generations, the fitness of all populations had increased relative to the common ancestor, but to different extents. Populations evolved in glucose improved the least, whereas populations evolving in maltose or lactose increased the most in their respective sets. Among-population divergence also differed across regimes, with variation higher in those groups that evolved in fluctuating environments than in those that faced constant resource regimens. This divergence under the fluctuating conditions increased between 1000 and 2000 generations, consistent with replicate populations evolving toward distinct adaptive peaks. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that environmental heterogeneity can give rise to more rugged adaptive landscapes, which in turn promote evolutionary diversification. These results also demonstrate that this effect depends on the form of environmental heterogeneity, with greater divergence when the pairs of resources fluctuated temporally rather than being presented simultaneously.},

We demonstrate that noise in {comK} expression selects cells for competence and that experimental reduction of this noise decreases the number of competent cells. We also show that transitions are limited temporally by a reduction in {comK} transcription. These results illustrate how such stochastic transitions are regulated in a natural system and suggest that noise characteristics are subject to evolutionary forces.},

	abstract = {In Kellis et {aL} (2003), we reported the genome sequences of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, and S. bayanus and compared these three yeast species to their close relative, S. cerevisiae. Genomewide comparative analysis allowed the identification of functionally important sequences, both coding and noncoding. In this companion paper we describe the mathematical and algorithmic results underpinning the analysis of these genomes. (1) We present methods for the automatic determination of genome correspondence. The algorithms enabled the automatic identification of orthologs for more than 90\% of genes and intergenic regions across the four species despite the large number of duplicated genes in the yeast genome. The remaining ambiguities in the gene correspondence revealed recent gene family expansions in regions of rapid genomic change. (2) We present methods for the identification of protein-coding genes based on their patterns of nucleotide conservation across related species. We observed the pressure to conserve the reading frame of functional proteins and developed a test for gene identification with high sensitivity and specificity. We used this test to revisit the genome of S. cerevisiae, reducing the overall gene count by 500 genes (10\% of previously annotated genes) and refining the gene structure of hundreds of genes. (3) We present novel methods for the systematic de novo identification of regulatory motifs. The methods do not rely on previous knowledge of gene function and in that way differ from the current literature on computational motif discovery. Based on genomewide conservation patterns of known motifs, we developed three conservation criteria that we used to discover novel motifs. We used an enumeration approach to select strongly conserved motif cores, which we extended and collapsed into a small number of candidate regulatory motifs. These include most previously known regulatory motifs as well as several noteworthy novel motifs. The majority of discovered motifs are enriched in functionally related genes, allowing us to infer a candidate function for novel motifs. Our results demonstrate the power of comparative genomics to further our understanding of any species. Our methods are validated by the extensive experimental knowledge in yeast and will be invaluable in the study of complex genomes like that of the human.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Our concept of a stable genome is evolving to one in which genomes are plastic and responsive to environmental changes. Growing evidence shows that a variety of environmental stresses induce genomic instability in bacteria, yeast, and human cancer cells, generating occasional fitter mutants and potentially accelerating adaptive evolution. The emerging molecular mechanisms of stress-induced mutagenesis vary but share telling common components that underscore two common themes. The first is the regulation of mutagenesis in time by cellular stress responses, which promote random mutations specifically when cells are poorly adapted to their environments, i.e., when they are stressed. A second theme is the possible restriction of random mutagenesis in genomic space, achieved via coupling of mutation-generating machinery to local events such as {DNA-break} repair or transcription. Such localization may minimize accumulation of deleterious mutations in the genomes of rare fitter mutants, and promote local concerted evolution. Although mutagenesis induced by stresses other than direct damage to {DNA} was previously controversial, evidence for the existence of various stress-induced mutagenesis programs is now overwhelming and widespread. Such mechanisms probably fuel evolution of microbial pathogenesis and antibiotic-resistance, and tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance, all of which occur under stress, driven by mutations. The emerging commonalities in stress-induced-mutation mechanisms provide hope for new therapeutic interventions for all of these processes.},

Such pre-eminent involvement of entropy is observed in the experimental results and, from a macroscopic point of view, is also reflected for instance by the steric hindrances introduced by cis-unsaturated and branched lipids to maintain membrane fluidity, by the loose conformation of psychrophilic proteins or by the local destabilization of {tRNA} by dihydrouridine in psychrophilic bacteria.},

	abstract = {In this report, a genome-scale reconstruction of Bacillus subtilis metabolism and its iterative development based on the combination of genomic, biochemical, and physiological information and high-throughput phenotyping experiments is presented. The initial reconstruction was converted into an in silico model and expanded in a four-step iterative fashion. First, network gap analysis was used to identify 48 missing reactions that are needed for growth but were not found in the genome annotation. Second, the computed growth rates under aerobic conditions were compared with high-throughput phenotypic screen data, and the initial in silico model could predict the outcomes qualitatively in 140 of 271 cases considered. Detailed analysis of the incorrect predictions resulted in the addition of 75 reactions to the initial reconstruction, and 200 of 271 cases were correctly computed. Third, in silico computations of the growth phenotypes of knock-out strains were found to be consistent with experimental observations in 720 of 766 cases evaluated. Fourth, the integrated analysis of the large-scale substrate utilization and gene essentiality data with the genome-scale metabolic model revealed the requirement of 80 specific enzymes (transport, 53; intracellular reactions, 27) that were not in the genome annotation. Subsequent sequence analysis resulted in the identification of genes that could be putatively assigned to 13 intracellular enzymes. The final reconstruction accounted for 844 open reading frames and consisted of 1020 metabolic reactions and 988 metabolites. Hence, the in silico model can be used to obtain experimentally verifiable hypothesis on the metabolic functions of various genes.},

The biological stationary state, the G, state, is a global attractor of the dynamics. The biological pathway, the cell-cycle sequence of protein states, is a globally attracting trajectory of the dynamics.

	abstract = {Environmental surveys indicate that the Archaea are diverse and abundant not only in extreme environments, but also in soil, oceans and freshwater, where they may fulfil a key role in the biogeochemical cycles of the planet. Archaea display unique capacities, such as methanogenesis and survival at temperatures higher than 90 degrees C, that make them crucial for understanding the nature of the biota of early Earth. Molecular, genomics and phylogenetics data strengthen Woese's definition of Archaea as a third domain of life in addition to Bacteria and Eukarya. Phylogenomics analyses of the components of different molecular systems are highlighting a core of mainly vertically inherited genes in Archaea. This allows recovering a globally well-resolved picture of archaeal evolution, as opposed to what is observed for Bacteria and Eukarya. This may be due to the fact that no rapid divergence occurred at the emergence of present-day archaeal lineages. This phylogeny supports a hyperthermophilic and non-methanogenic ancestor to present-day archaeal lineages, and a profound divergence between two major phyla, the Crenarchaeota and the Euryarchaeota, that may not have an equivalent in the other two domains of life. Nanoarchaea may not represent a third and ancestral archaeal phylum, but a fast-evolving euryarchaeal lineage. Methanogenesis seems to have appeared only once and early in the evolution of Euryarchaeota. Filling up this picture of archaeal evolution by adding presently uncultivated species, and placing it back in geological time remain two essential goals for the future.},

	abstract = {Query-based biclustering techniques allow interrogating a gene expression compendium with a given gene or gene list. They do so by searching for genes in the compendium that have a profile close to the average expression profile of the genes in this query-list. As it can often not be guaranteed that the genes in a long query-list will all be mutually coexpressed, it is advisable to use each gene separately as a query. This approach, however, leaves the user with a tedious post-processing of partially redundant biclustering results. The fact that for each query-gene multiple parameter settings need to be tested in order to detect the 'most optimal bicluster size' adds to the redundancy {problem.To} aid with this post-processing, we developed an ensemble approach to be used in combination with query-based biclustering. The method relies on a specifically designed consensus matrix in which the biclustering outcomes for multiple query-genes and for different possible parameter settings are merged in a statistically robust way. Clustering of this matrix results in distinct, non-redundant consensus biclusters that maximally reflect the information contained within the original query-based biclustering results. The usefulness of the developed approach is illustrated on a biological case study in Escherichia coli.

The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

	abstract = {Bacteria serve as the central arena for understanding how gene networks and proteins process information and control cellular behaviors. Recently, much effort has been devoted to the investigation of specific bacteria gene circuits as functioning modules. The next challenge is the integrative modeling of complex cellular networks composed of many such modules. A tractable integrative model of the sophisticated decision-making signal transduction system that determines the fate between sporulation and competence is presented. This model provides an understanding of how information is sensed and processed to reach an "informative” decision in the context of cell state and signals from other cells. The competence module ({ComK} dynamics) is modeled as a stochastic switch whose transition rate is controlled by a quorum-sensing unit. The sporulation module ({Spo0A} dynamics) is modeled as a timer whose clock rate is adjusted by a stress-sensing unit. The interplay between these modules is mediated via the Rap assessment system, which gates the sensing units, and the {AbrB-Rok} decision module, which creates an opportunity for competence within a specific window of the sporulation timer. The timer is regulated via a special repressilator-like inhibition of {Spo0A*} by {Spo0E}, which is itself inhibited by {AbrB.} For some stress and input signals, this repressilator can generate a frustration state with large variations (fluctuations or oscillations) in {Spo0A*} and {AbrB} concentrations, which might serve an important role in generating cell variability. This integrative framework is a starting point that can be extended to include transition into cannibalism and the role of colony organization.},

	doi = {10.2307/2410639},
	abstract = {The problem of complex adaptations is studied in two largely disconnected research traditions: evolutionary biology and evolutionary computer science. This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess ”evolvability,” i.e., the ability of random variations to sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic; variation maps onto phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility, developmental dissociability, and morphological integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has important implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by mutation and selection? Is the genotype phenotype map able to change in evolution? What are the selective forces, if any, that shape the genotype-phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes: epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of different functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a modular design. While our current knowledge is insufficient to assess the plausibility of these models, they form the beginning of a framework for understanding the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map.},

Here, we present the molecular phylogenies of several new piezophiles of widely differing geographic origins. Included are results from an analysis of the first deep-trench bacterial isolates recovered from the southern hemisphere (9.9-km depth) and of the first gram-positive piezophilic strains. These new data allowed both phylogenetic and structural {16S} {rRNA} comparisons among deep-ocean trench piezophiles and closely related strains not adapted to high pressure. Our results suggest that (i) the Circumpolar Deep Water acts as repository for hyperpiezophiles and drives their dissemination to deep trenches in the Pacific Ocean and (ii) the occurrence of elongated helices in the {16S} {rRNA} genes increases with the extent of adaptation to growth at elevated pressure.

But integrating data from multiple sources is often encumbered by the need to reformat data files, convert between naming systems, or perform ongoing maintenance of local copies of public databases. Opportunities for new ways of combining and re-using data are arising as a result of the increasing use of web protocols to transmit structured data. {RESULTS:} The Firegoose, an extension to the Mozilla Firefox web browser, enables data transfer between web sites and desktop tools. As a component of the Gaggle integration framework, Firegoose can also exchange data with Cytoscape, the R statistical package, Multiexperiment Viewer ({MeV)}, and several other popular desktop software tools. Firegoose adds the capability to easily use local data to query {KEGG}, {EMBL} {STRING}, {DAVID}, and other widely-used bioinformatics web sites. Query results from these web sites can be transferred to desktop tools for further analysis with a few clicks. Firegoose acquires data from the web by screen scraping, microformats, embedded {XML}, or web services. We define a microformat, which allows structured information compatible with the Gaggle to be embedded in {HTML} documents. We demonstrate the capabilities of this software by performing an analysis of the genes activated in the microbe Halobacterium salinarum {NRC-1} in response to anaerobic environments. Starting with microarray data, we explore functions of differentially expressed genes by combining data from several public web resources and construct an integrated view of the cellular processes involved. {CONCLUSION:} The Firegoose incorporates Mozilla Firefox into the Gaggle environment and enables interactive sharing of data between diverse web resources and desktop software tools without maintaining local copies. Additional web sites can be incorporated easily into the framework using the scripting platform of the Firefox browser. Performing data integration in the browser allows the excellent search and navigation capabilities of the browser to be used in combination with powerful desktop tools.},

Our method automatically tailors itself to each genome using sequence information alone, and thus can be applied to any prokaryote. For Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis, our method is 85 and 83\% accurate, respectively, which is similar to the accuracy of methods that use the same features but are trained on experimentally characterized transcripts. In Halobacterium {NRC-1} and in Helicobacter pylori, our method correctly infers that genes in operons are separated by shorter distances than they are in E.coli, and its predictions using distance alone are more accurate than distance-only predictions trained on a database of E.coli transcripts. We use microarray data from six phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes to show that combining intergenic distance with comparative genomic measures further improves accuracy and that our method is broadly effective. Finally, we survey operon structure across 124 genomes, and find several surprises: H.pylori has many operons, contrary to previous reports; Bacillus anthracis has an unusual number of pseudogenes within conserved operons; and Synechocystis {PCC} 6803 has many operons even though it has unusually wide spacings between conserved adjacent genes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulatory networks ({TRNs)} change through evolution is a fundamental problem. Here, we analyze this question using data from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and find that paralogy relationships are insufficient to explain the global or local role observed for transcription factors ({TFs)} within regulatory networks. Our results provide a picture in which {DNA-binding} specificity, a molecular property that can be measured in different ways, is a predictor of the role of transcription factors. In particular, we observe that global regulators consistently display low levels of binding specificity, while displaying comparatively higher expression values in microarray experiments. In addition, we find a strong negative correlation between binding specificity and the number of co-regulators that help coordinate genetic expression on a genomic scale. A close look at several orthologous {TFs}, including {FNR}, a regulator found to be global in E. coli and local in B. subtilis, confirms the diagnostic value of specificity in order to understand their regulatory function, and highlights the importance of evaluating the metabolic and ecological relevance of effectors as another variable in the evolutionary equation of regulatory networks. Finally, a general model is presented that integrates some evolutionary forces and molecular properties, aiming to explain how regulons grow and shrink, as bacteria tune their regulation to increase adaptation.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The} learning of global genetic regulatory networks from expression data is a severely under-constrained problem that is aided by reducing the dimensionality of the search space by means of clustering genes into putatively co-regulated groups, as opposed to those that are simply co-expressed. Be cause genes may be co-regulated only across a subset of all observed experimental conditions, biclustering (clustering of genes and conditions) is more appropriate than standard clustering. Co-regulated genes are also often functionally (physically, spatially, genetically, and/or evolutionarily) associated, and such a priori known or pre-computed associations can provide support for appropriately grouping genes. One important association is the presence of one or more common cis-regulatory motifs. In organisms where these motifs are not known, their de novo detection, integrated into the clustering algorithm, can help to guide the process towards more biologically parsimonious {solutions.RESULTS:We} have developed an algorithm, {cMonkey}, that detects putative co-regulated gene groupings by integrating the biclustering of gene expression data and various functional associations with the de novo detection of sequence {motifs.CONCLUSION:We} have applied this procedure to the archaeon Halobacterium {NRC-1}, as part of our efforts to decipher its regulatory network. In addition, we used {cMonkey} on public data for three organisms in the other two domains of life: Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli. The biclusters detected by {cMonkey} both recapitulated known biology and enabled novel predictions (some for Halobacterium were subsequently confirmed in the laboratory). For example, it identified the bacteriorhodopsin regulon, assigned additional genes to this regulon with apparently unrelated function, and detected its known promoter motif. We have performed a thorough comparison of {cMonkey} results against other clustering methods, and find that {cMonkey} biclusters are more parsimonious with all available evidence for co-regulation.},

Representative genotypes from each population were assayed for fitness relative to their common ancestor in the experimental glucose environment and in 11 novel single-nutrient environments. After 2000 generations, the 12 derived genotypes had diverged into at least six distinct phenotypic classes. The nutrients were classified into four groups based upon their uptake physiology. All 12 derived genotypes improved in fitness by similar amounts in the glucose environment, and this pattern of parallel fitness gains was also seen in those novel environments where the limiting nutrient shared uptake mechanisms with glucose. Fitness showed little or no consistent improvement, but much greater genetic variation, in novel environments where the limiting nutrient differed from glucose in its uptake mechanisms. This pattern of fitness Variation in the novel nutrient environments suggests that the independently derived genotypes adapted to the glucose environment by similar, but not identical, changes in the physiological mechanisms for moving glucose across both the inner and outer membranes.},

It is therefore of interest to look for generic ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of evolution, defined as the number of generations needed for an initially random population to achieve a given goal. Using computer simulations, we find that evolution toward goals that change over time can, in certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals change overtime such that each new goal shares some of the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions. This study suggests that varying environments might significantly contribute to the speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a way to accelerate optimization algorithms and improve evolutionary approaches in engineering.},

	abstract = {Fitness represents the combined effects of all other phenotypic properties on the capacity for survival and reproduction by a particular genotype in a particular environment. For most environmental application of genetically modified microorganisms, efficacy will be enhanced if the engineered genotype is more fit than its wild-type counterpart in the target environment. However, inadvertent spread of the engineered genotype will be less likely if it is less fit than the wild-type. Thus, the fate of a population of genetically engineered microorganisms, and the likelihood and magnitude of any environmental effects (whether beneficial or detrimental), will be strongly influenced by the relative fitnesses of modified and unmodified genotypes. In this chapter, I have presented theoretical principles and empirical methods for determining the relative fitnesses of engineered and wild-type clones. Selection coefficients were used to provide a quantitative measure of the difference in fitness between the two clones in a particular environment. Many engineered genotypes are unstable, such that their frequencies decline with time. Instability may be caused by infidelity of replication or transmission of a particular gene (which is termed segregation), or it may be caused by a difference in the fitness of genotypes that retain or have lost that gene (selection). In this chapter, I have also presented theoretical principles and empirical methods for distinguishing the effects of selection and segregation. Finally, it should be emphasized that selection coefficients and segregation rates can be estimated not only in highly simplified laboratory systems, but also in more complex natural or semi-natural systems, such as microcosms. All that is required is the ability to monitor the relative abundance of two clones (e.g., engineered and wild-type) that share a common environment.},

Therefore, in an attempt to characterize unique and shared responses to chemically similar metals, we have reconstructed physiological behaviors of Halobacterium {NRC-1}, an archaeal halophile, in sublethal levels of Mn({II)}, Fe({II)}, Co({II)}, Ni({II)}, Cu({II)}, and Zn({II).} Over 20\% of all genes responded transiently within minutes of exposure to Fe({II)}, perhaps reflecting immediate large-scale physiological adjustments to maintain homeostasis. At steady state, each transition metal induced growth arrest, attempts to minimize oxidative stress, toxic ion scavenging, increased protein turnover and {DNA} repair, and modulation of active ion transport. While several of these constitute generalized stress responses, up-regulation of active efflux of Co({II)}, Ni({II)}, Cu({II)}, and Zn({II)}, down-regulation of Mn({II)} uptake and up-regulation of Fe({II)} chelation, confer resistance to the respective metals. We have synthesized all of these discoveries into a unified systems-level model to provide an integrated perspective of responses to six transition metals with emphasis on experimentally verified regulatory mechanisms. Finally, through comparisons across global transcriptional responses to different metals, we provide insights into putative in vivo metal selectivity of metalloregulatory proteins and demonstrate that a systems approach can help rapidly unravel novel metabolic potential and regulatory programs of poorly studied organisms.},

We grouped publicly available {16S} ribosomal {RNA} sequences into operational taxonomic units at various levels of resolution and systematically searched these for co-occurrence across environments. Naturally occurring microbes, indeed, exhibited numerous, significant interlineage associations. These ranged from relatively specific groupings encompassing only a few lineages, to larger assemblages of microbes with shared habitat preferences. Many of the coexisting lineages were phylogenetically closely related, but a significant number of distant associations were observed as well. The increased availability of completely sequenced genomes allowed us, for the first time, to search for genomic correlates of such ecological associations. Genomes from coexisting microbes tended to be more similar than expected by chance, both with respect to pathway content and genome size, and outliers from these trends are discussed.

Biochemical Adaptation: Mechanisms and Process in Physiological Evolution asks two primary questions. First, how have the core biochemical systems found in all species been adaptively modified to allow the same fundamental types of physiological processes to be sustained throughout the wide range of habitat conditions found in the biosphere? Second, through what types of genetic and biochemical processes have new physiological functions been fabricated? The primary audience for this book is faculty, senior undergraduates, and graduate students in environmental biology, comparative physiology, and marine biology.

	abstract = {Summary. We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called {LARS-EN} is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm {LARS} does for the lasso.},

Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for {\textbackslash}textgreater30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit(+)) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit(+) mutants among 8.4 x 1012 ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 1012 cells from},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Systems biologists work with many kinds of data, from many different sources, using a variety of software tools. Each of these tools typically excels at one type of analysis, such as of microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming) data resources and tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology data sets. A solution to this problem should recognize that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age of biology are constantly changing. {RESULTS:} In this paper we describe the Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software environment that helps to solve the problem of software and database integration. Guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended environment. We demonstrate that four simple data types (names, matrices, networks, and associative arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software. We highlight some capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools. {CONCLUSION:} We have integrated diverse databases (for example, {KEGG}, {BioCyc}, String) and software (Cytoscape, {DataMatrixViewer}, R statistical environment, and {TIGR} Microarray Expression Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse software and databases the Gaggle enables simultaneous exploration of experimental data ({mRNA} and protein abundance, protein-protein and protein-{DNA} interactions), functional associations (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic pattern), metabolic pathways ({KEGG)} and Pubmed abstracts ({STRING} web resource), creating an exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy computational biologists, and those in between. The Gaggle uses Java {RMI} and Java Web Start technologies and can be found at http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net.},

Analysis of microarray data revealed that adenine stimulation led to changes in transcript level of about 10\% of Escherichia coli genes, including the purine biosynthesis pathway. The E. coli strain lacking the {purR} gene showed that a total of 56 genes are affected by the deletion. From the {ChIP-chip} analysis, we determined that over 73\% of genes directly regulated by {PurR} were enriched in the biosynthesis, utilization and transport of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, and 20\% of them were functionally unknown. Compared to the functional diversity of the regulon of the other general transcription factors in E. coli, the functions and size of the {PurR} regulon are limited.},

	abstract = {Two-component signal transduction systems enable bacteria to sense, respond, and adapt to a wide range of environments, stressors, and growth conditions. In the prototypical two-component system, a sensor histidine kinase catalyzes its autophosphorylation and then subsequently transfers the phosphoryl group to a response regulator, which can then effect changes in cellular physiology, often by regulating gene expression. The utility of these signaling systems is underscored by their prevalence throughout the bacterial kingdom and by the fact that many bacteria contain dozens, or sometimes hundreds, of these signaling proteins. The presence of so many highly related signaling proteins in individual cells creates both an opportunity and a challenge. Do cells take advantage of the similarity between signaling proteins to integrate signals or diversify responses, and thereby enhance their ability to process information? Conversely, how do cells prevent unwanted cross-talk and maintain the insulation of distinct pathways? Here we address both questions by reviewing the cellular and molecular mechanisms that dictate the specificity of two-component signaling pathways.},

Although bet hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans(4-10), direct evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking(11). Here we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however, in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor. The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments.},

Each stress generated the transient induction of a specific set of genes including classic markers observed in the stress responses of other organisms. We noted that the classical hallmarks of the general stress response observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are absent from C. albicans; no C. albicans genes were significantly induced in a common response to the three stresses. This observation is supported by our inability to detect stress cross-protection in C. albicans. Similarly, in C. albicans there is essentially no induction of carbohydrate reserves like glycogen and trehalose in response to a mild stress, unlike the situation in S. cerevisiae. Thus C. albicans lacks the strong general stress response exhibited by S. cerevisiae.},

	abstract = {During the genomic revolution, algorithmic and analytical methods for organizing, integrating, analyzing, and querying biological sequence data proved invaluable. Today, increasing availability of high-throughput data pertaining to functional states of biomolecules, as well as their interactions, enables genome-scale studies of the cell from a systems perspective. The past decade witnessed significant efforts on the development of computational infrastructure for large-scale modeling and analysis of biological systems, commonly using network models. Such efforts lead to novel insights into the complexity of living systems, through development of sophisticated abstractions, algorithms, and analytical techniques that address a broad range of problems, including the following: (1) inference and reconstruction of complex cellular networks; (2) identification of common and coherent patterns in cellular networks, with a view to understanding the organizing principles and building blocks of cellular signaling, regulation, and metabolism; and (3) characterization of cellular mechanisms that underlie the differences between living systems, in terms of evolutionary diversity, development and differentiation, and complex phenotypes, including human disease. These problems pose significant algorithmic and analytical challenges because of the inherent complexity of the systems being studied; limitations of data in terms of availability, scope, and scale; intractability of resulting computational problems; and limitations of reference models for reliable statistical inference. This article provides a broad overview of existing algorithmic and analytical approaches to these problems, highlights key biological insights provided by these approaches, and outlines emerging opportunities and challenges in computational systems biology.

	abstract = {The organization of bacterial genes into operons was originally ascribed to the benefits of co-regulation. More recently, the "selfish operon" model, in which operons are formed by repeated gain and loss of genes, was proposed. Indeed, operons are often subject to horizontal gene transfer ({HGT).} On the other hand, non-{HGT} genes are particularly likely to be in operons. To clarify whether {HGT} is involved in operon formation, we identified recently formed operons in Escherichia coli K12. We show that genes that have homologs in distantly related bacteria but not in close relatives of E. coli–indicating {HGT–form} new operons at about the same rates as native genes. Furthermore, genes in new operons are no more likely than other genes to have phylogenetic trees that are inconsistent with the species tree. In contrast, essential genes and ubiquitous genes without paralogs–genes believed to undergo {HGT} rarely–often form new operons. We conclude that {HGT} is not a cause of operon formation but instead promotes the prevalence of pre-existing operons. To explain operon formation, we propose that new operons reduce the amount of regulatory information required to specify optimal expression patterns and infer that operons should be more likely to evolve than independent promoters when regulation is complex. Consistent with this hypothesis, operons have greater amounts of conserved regulatory sequences than do individually transcribed genes.},

This has revealed a multi-tiered {OS-management} program to transcriptionally coordinate three peroxidase/catalase enzymes, two superoxide dismutases, production of rhodopsins, carotenoids and gas vesicles, metal trafficking, and various other aspects of metabolism. Through experimental validation of interactions within the {OSR} regulatory network, we show that despite their inability to directly sense reactive oxygen species, general transcription factors have an important function in coordinating this response. Remarkably, a significant fraction of this {OSR} was accurately recapitulated by a model that was earlier constructed from cellular responses to diverse environmental perturbations-this constitutes the general stress response component.

To explore network evolvability, we constructed 598 recombinations of promoters ( including regulatory regions) with different transcription or sigma-factor genes in Escherichia coli, added over a wild- type genetic background. Here we show that similar to 95\% of new networks are tolerated by the bacteria, that very few alter growth, and that expression level correlates with factor position in the wild- type network hierarchy. Most importantly, we find that certain networks consistently survive over the wild type under various selection pressures. Therefore new links in the network are rarely a barrier for evolution and can even confer a fitness advantage.},

Analysis of the {PA} with respect to biophysical properties of constituent peptides, functional properties of parent proteins of detected peptides, and performance of different mass spectrometry approaches has highlighted plausible strategies for improving proteome coverage and selecting signature peptides for targeted proteomics. Notably, discovery of a significant correlation between absolute abundances of {mRNAs} and proteins has helped identify low abundance of proteins as the major limitation in peptide detection. Furthermore, we have discovered that {iTRAQ} labeling for quantitative proteomic analysis introduces a significant bias in peptide detection by mass spectrometry.

	doi = {10.1007/s10709-006-0035-0},
	abstract = {The relationship between the topology of a biological network and its functional or evolutionary properties has attracted much recent interest. It has been suggested that most, if not all, biological networks are 'scale free.' That is, their connections follow power-law distributions, such that there are very few nodes with very many connections and vice versa. The number of target genes of known transcriptional regulators in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appears to follow such a distribution, as do other networks, such as the yeast network of protein-protein interactions. These findings have inspired attempts to draw biological inferences from general properties associated with scale-free network topology. One often cited general property is that, when compromised, highly connected nodes will tend to have a larger effect on network function than sparsely connected nodes. For example, more highly connected proteins are more likely to be lethal when knocked out. However, the correlation between lethality and connectivity is relatively weak, and some highly connected proteins can be removed without noticeable phenotypic effect. Similarly, network topology only weakly predicts the response of gene expression to environmental perturbations. Evolutionary simulations of gene-regulatory networks, presented here, suggest that such weak or non-existent correlations are to be expected, and are likely not due to inadequacy of experimental data. We argue that 'top-down' inferences of biological properties based on simple measures of network topology are of limited utility, and we present simulation results suggesting that much more detailed information about a gene's location in a regulatory network, as well as dynamic gene-expression data, are needed to make more meaningful functional and evolutionary predictions. Specifically, we find in our simulations that: (1) the relationship between a gene's connectivity and its fitness effect upon knockout depends on its equilibrium expression level; (2) correlation between connectivity and genetic variation is virtually non-existent, yet upon independent evolution of networks with identical topologies, some nodes exhibit consistently low or high polymorphism; and (3) certain genes show low polymorphism yet high divergence among independent evolutionary runs. This latter pattern is generally taken as a signature of positive selection, but in our simulations its cause is often neutral coevolution of regulatory inputs to the same gene.},

At a global level, these regulatory networks display a scale-free topology, indicating the presence of regulatory hubs. At a local level, substructures such as motifs and modules can be discerned in these networks. Despite the general organisational similarity of networks across the phylogenetic spectrum, there are interesting qualitative differences among the network components, such as the transcription factors. Although the {DNA-binding} domains of the transcription factors encoded by a given organism are drawn from a small set of ancient conserved superfamilies, their relative abundance often shows dramatic variation among different phylogenetic groups. Large portions of these networks appear to have evolved through extensive duplication of transcription factors and targets, often with inheritance of regulatory interactions from the ancestral gene. Interactions are conserved to varying degrees among genomes. Insights from the structure and evolution of these networks can be translated into predictions and used for engineering of the regulatory networks of different organisms.},

Sponges contain large numbers of bacteria that are embedded within the animal matrix. The phylogeny of these bacteria and the evolutionary age of the interaction are virtually unknown. In order to provide insights into the species richness of the microbial community of sponges, we performed a comprehensive diversity survey based on 190 sponge-derived 165 ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA)} sequences. The sponges Aplysina aerophoba and Theonella swinhoei were chosen for construction of the bacterial {16S} {rDNA} library because they are taxonomically distantly related and they populate nonoverlapping geographic regions. In both sponges, a uniform microbial community was discovered whose phylogenetic signature is distinctly different from that of marine plankton or marine sediments. Altogether 14 monophyletic, sponge-specific sequence clusters were identified that belong to at least seven different bacterial divisions. By definition, the sequences of each cluster are more closely related to each other than to a sequence from nonsponge sources. These monophyletic clusters comprise 70\% of all publicly available sponge-derived 165 {rDNA} sequences, reflecting the generality of the observed phenomenon. This shared microbial fraction represents the smallest common denominator of the sponges investigated in this study. Bacteria that are exclusively found in certain host species or that occur only transiently would have been missed. A picture emerges where sponges can be viewed as highly concentrated reservoirs of so far uncultured and elusive marine microorganisms.},

Escherichia coli K12 does not use exogenous heme, and no heme uptake genes have been identified. Nevertheless, a recombinant E. coli strain expressing just one foreign heme outer membrane receptor can use exogenous heme as an iron source. This result suggests either that heme might be able to cross the cytoplasmic membrane in the absence of specific carrier or that there is a functional inner membrane heme transporter. Here, we show that to use heme iron E. coli requires the dipeptide inner membrane {ATP-binding} cassette transporter ({DppBCDF)} and either of two periplasmic binding proteins: {MppA}, the L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate binding protein, or {DppA}, the dipeptide binding protein. Thus, wild-type E. coli has a peptide/heme permease despite being unable to use exogenous heme. {DppA}, which shares sequence similarity with the Haemophilus influenzae heme-binding protein {HbpA}, and {MppA} are functional heme-binding proteins.

In order to better understand how Geobacter species might adapt to selective pressure for faster metal reduction in the subsurface, Geobacter sulfurreducens was put under selective pressure for rapid Fe({III)} oxide reduction. The genomes of two resultant strains with rates of Fe({III)} oxide reduction that were 10-fold higher than those of the parent strain were resequenced. Both strains contain either a single base-pair change or a 1 nucleotide insertion in a {GEMM} riboswitch upstream of {GSU1761}, a gene coding for the periplasmic c-type cytochrome designated {PgcA.} {GSU1771}, a gene coding for a {SARP} regulator, was also mutated in both strains. Introduction of either of the {GEMM} riboswitch mutations upstream of {pgcA} in the wild-type increased the abundance of {pgcA} transcripts, consistent with increased expression of {pgcA} in the adapted strains. One of the mutations doubled the rate of Fe({III)} oxide reduction. Interruption of {GSU1771} doubled the Fe({III)} oxide reduction rate. This was associated with an increased in expression of {pilA}, the gene encoding the structural protein for the pili thought to function as microbial nanowires. The combination of the {GSU1771} interruption with either of the {pgcA} mutations resulted in a strain that reduced Fe({III)} as fast as the comparable adapted strain. These results suggest that the accumulation of a small number of beneficial mutations under selective pressure, similar to that potentially present during bioremediation, can greatly enhance the capacity for Fe({III)} oxide reduction in G. sulfurreducens. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of the c-type cytochrome {PgcA} and pili in Fe({III)} oxide reduction and demonstrate how adaptive evolution studies can aid in the elucidation of complex mechanisms, such as extracellular electron transfer.},

	abstract = {In various organisms loss-of-function mutations of individual genes with unexpectedly weak or no phenotypic effects in the homozygous state have been observed. Tn several of these cases, independent evidence shows that the respective gene products do have essential biological functions. An explanation emerging from detailed biochemical and genetic studies on such genes is that two or more genetically redundant genes contribute to that function, i.e., a group of genes that is able to substitute partially for a loss of function in one member of that group. The often-observed sequence similarity among redundant genes suggests gene duplications as a frequent source of genetic redundancy. Aside from this observation, the evolution of genetic redundancy is poorly understood. Genetic redundancy is potentially of great relevance to organismal evolution, since it may (i) 'protect' organisms from potentially harmful mutations, and (ii) maintain pools of functionally similar, yet diverse gene products, and thus represent a source of evolutionary novelty at the biochemical level. The question of how genetic redundancy evolves should ideally be answered by experimentation. However, the large time scales involved and insufficient quantitative understanding of the underlying regulatory pathways are likely to preclude such an approach in the foreseeable future. Preliminary answers are sought here by using a biochemically motivated model of a small. but central part of a developmental pathway. Sets of transcription regulators are modeled that mutually regulate each other's expression and thereby form stable gene expression patterns. It is then studied how genetic redundancy caused by gene duplications might evolve in such networks. The results obtained suggest that redundancy may, at least in some cases, be a global property of gene interactions within a regulatory pathway, rather than a local property of genes in that pathway. They also raise the possibility that duplications of a whole regulatory gene network, as may have taken place during the evolution of {HOM/Hox} genes in chordates, are less likely to be reversible (by gene deletions) than duplications of individual network genes. These findings are discussed with reference to experimental evidence on the evolution of {HOM/Hox} genes.},

Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) encounters a variety of such environments throughout its infection cycle, including high concentrations of the short-chain fatty acid, Propionate ({PA)}, during food processing and within the gut of infected hosts. With this study, we aimed to elucidate the significance of {PA} adaptation on stress resistance in S. Enteritidis. Methods and Results: We have shown (utilizing in vitro stress assays) that S. Enteritidis grown to stationary phase in the presence of {PA} has a dramatically enhanced resistance to commonly encountered in vivo stressors, including extreme acidity and oxidative/nitrosative stresses when compared to unadapted salmonellae. However, competitive infection between {PA} adapted and unadapted cells within a murine model showed that adapted cells were at a distinct disadvantage in vivo, resulting in decreased caecal colonization in infected mice. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, while long-term {PA} adaptation induces strong resistance to specific stresses in vitro, it also reduces the overall infectivity of the adapted cells by inhibiting the organism's colonization ability. Significance and Impact of the Study: In S. Enteritidis, {PA} adaptation is strongly associated with the induction of stress-resistant phenotypes in vitro. Enhanced stress resistance ex vivo may increase environmental persistence and/or the overall transmissibility of this pathogen, while overall the virulence of the pathogen is likely to be hindered as a result of the decreased colonization ability of {PA-adapted} S. Enteritidis.},

The evolving genomes became increasingly different from their ancestor over time. Moreover, tremendous diversity accumulated within each population, such that almost every individual had a different genetic fingerprint after 10,000 generations. As has been often suggested, but not previously shown by experiment, the rates of phenotypic and genomic change were discordant, both across replicate populations and over time within a population. Certain pivotal mutations were shared by all descendants in a population, and these are candidates for beneficial mutations, which are rare and difficult to find. More generally, these data show that the genome is highly dynamic even over a time scale that is, from an evolutionary perspective, very brief.},

The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of {16S} {rRNA} gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of {16S} {rRNA} genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na(+) (Li({+))/H(+)} antiportet; {RecA}, {DNA} polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community.

We have developed a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of gene regulatory sequences by cloning {DNase} {HS} sites. We generated a library of {DNase} {HS} sites from quiescent primary human {CD4(+)} T cells and analyzed approximately 5600 of the resulting clones. Compared to sequences from randomly generated in silico libraries, sequences from these clones were found to map more frequently to regions of the genome known to contain regulatory elements, such as regions upstream of genes, within {CpG} islands, and in sequences that align between mouse and human. These cloned sites also tend to map near genes that have detectable transcripts in {CD4(+)} T cells, demonstrating that transcriptionally active regions of the genome are being selected. Validation of putative regulatory elements was achieved by repeated recovery of the same sequence and real-time {PCR.} This cloning strategy, which can be scaled up and applied to any cell line or tissue, will be useful in identifying regulatory elements controlling global expression differences that delineate tissue types, stages of development, and disease susceptibility.},

During model murine nasal colonization, Haemophilus influenzae outcompetes another member of the local flora, Streptococcus pneumoniae, by recruiting neutrophils and stimulating the killing of complement-opsonized pneumococci [4]. For S. pneumoniae, resistance to opsonophagocytic killing is determined by its polysaccharide capsule [5, 6]. Although there are many capsule types among different S. pneumoniae isolates that allow for efficient colonization, virulent pneumococci express capsules that confer resistance to opsonophagocytic clearance. Modeling of interspecies interaction predicts that these more virulent S. pneumoniae will prevail during competition with H. influenzae, even if production of a capsule is otherwise costly. Experimental colonization studies confirmed the increased survival of the more virulent S. pneumoniae type during competition. Our findings demonstrate that competition between microbes during their commensal state may underlie selection for characteristics that allow invasive disease.},

In order to gain insight into the evolution of the E.coli regulatory network, we analysed information obtainable for the domains and protein families of the transcription factors and regulated genes. About three-quarters of the 271 transcription factors we identified are two-domain proteins, consisting of a {DNA-binding} domain along with a regulatory domain. The regulatory domains mainly bind small molecules. Many groups of transcription factors have identical domain architectures, and this implies that roughly three-quarters of the transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. In contrast, there is little evidence of duplication of regulatory regions together with regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes. Thirty-eight, out of the 121 transcription factors for which one or more regulated genes are known, regulate other transcription factors. This amplification effect, as well as large differences between the numbers of genes directly regulated by transcription factors, means that there are about 10 global regulators which each control many more genes than the other transcription factors.},

The genome is organized into nine circular replicons of varying {G+C} compositions ranging from 54\% to 62\%. Comparison of the genome architectures of Halobacterium sp. {NRC-1} and H. marismortui suggests a common ancestor for the two organisms and a genome of significantly reduced size in the former. Both of these halophilic archaea use the same strategy of high surface negative charge of folded proteins as means to circumvent the salting-out phenomenon in a hypersaline cytoplasm. A multitiered annotation approach, including primary sequence similarities, protein family signatures, structure prediction, and a protein function association network, has assigned putative functions for at least 58\% of the 4242 predicted proteins, a far larger number than is usually achieved in most newly sequenced microorganisms. Among these assigned functions were genes encoding six opsins, 19 {MCP} and/or {HAMP} domain signal transducers, and an unusually large number of environmental response regulators-nearly five times as many as those encoded in Halobacterium sp. {NRC-1–suggesting} H. marismortui is significantly more physiologically capable of exploiting diverse environments. In comparing the physiologies of the two halophilic archaea, in addition to the expected extensive similarity, we discovered several differences in their metabolic strategies and physiological responses such as distinct pathways for arginine breakdown in each halophile. Finally, as expected from the larger genome, H. marismortui encodes many more functions and seems to have fewer nutritional requirements for survival than does Halobacterium sp. {NRC-1.}},

Both morphology (cell size) and fitness (measured in competition with the ancestor) evolved rapidly for the first 2000 generations or so after the populations were introduced into the experimental environment, but both were nearly static for the last 5000 generations. Although evolving in identical environments, the replicate populations diverged significantly from one another in both morphology and mean fitness. The divergence in mean fitness was sustained and implies that the populations have approached different fitness peaks of unequal height in the adaptive landscape. Although the experimental time scale and environment were microevolutionary in scope, our experiments were designed to address questions concerning the origin as well as the fate of genetic and phenotypic novelties, the repeatability of adaptation, the diversification of lineages, and thus the causes and consequences of the uniqueness of evolutionary history. In fact, we observed several hallmarks of macroevolutionary dynamics, including periods of rapid evolution and stasis, altered functional relationships between traits, and concordance of anagenetic and cladogenetic trends. Our results support a Wrightian interpretation, in which chance events (mutation and drift) play an important role in adaptive evolution, as do the complex genetic interactions that underlie the structure of organisms.},

	abstract = {Background: Bacillus subtilis is one of the best-characterized organisms in Gram-positive bacteria. It represents a paradigm of gene regulation in bacteria due its complex life style ( which could involve a transition between stages as diverse as vegetative cell and spore formation). In order to gain insight into the organization and evolution of the B. subtilis regulatory network and to provide an alternative framework for further studies in bacteria, we identified and analyzed its repertoire of {DNA-binding} transcription factors in terms of their abundance, family distribution and regulated genes. Results: A collection of 237 {DNA-binding} Transcription Factors ({TFs)} was identified in B. subtilis, half of them with experimental evidence. 59\% of them were predicted to be repressors, 17\% activators, 17\% were putatively identified as dual regulatory proteins and the remaining 6.3\% could not be associated with a regulatory role. From this collection 56 {TFs} were found to be autoregulated, most of them negatively, though a significant proportion of positive feedback circuits were also identified. {TFs} were clustered into 51 regulatory protein families and then traced on 58 genomes from Firmicutes to detect their presence. From this analysis three families were found conserved in all the Firmicutes; fifteen families were distributed in all Firmicutes except in the phyla Mollicutes; two were constrained to Bacillales and finally two families were found to be specific to B. subtilis, due to their specie specific distribution. Repression seems to be the most common regulatory mechanism in Firmicutes due to the high proportion of repressors in the detected collection in these genomes. In addition, six global regulators were defined in B. subtilis based on the number and function of their regulated genes. Conclusion: In this work we identified and described the characteristics associated to the repertoire of {DNA-binding} {TFs} in B. subtilis. We also quantified their abundance, family distribution, and regulatory roles in the context of Firmicutes. This work should not only contribute to our understanding of the regulation of gene expression in bacteria from the perspective of B. subtilis but also provide us the basis for comprehensive modeling of transcriptional regulatory networks in Firmicutes.},

In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.},

	abstract = {Comparative analysis of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic genomes indicates that a significant fraction of the genes in the prokaryotic genomes have been subject to horizontal transfer, In some cases, the amount and source of horizontal gene transfer can be linked to an organism's lifestyle. For example, bacterial hyperthermophiles seem to have exchanged genes with archaea to a greater extent than other bacteria, whereas transfer of certain classes of eukaryotic genes is most common in parasitic and symbiotic bacteria. Horizontal transfer events can be classified into distinct categories of acquisition of new genes, acquisition of paralogs of existing genes, and xenologous gene displacement whereby a gene is displaced by a horizontally transferred ortholog from another lineage (xenolog). Each of these types of horizontal gene transfer is common among prokaryotes, but their relative contributions differ in different lineages. The fixation and long-term persistence of horizontally transferred genes suggests that they confer a selective advantage on the recipient organism. In most cases, the nature of this advantage remains unclear, but detailed examination of several cases of acquisition of eukaryotic genes by bacteria seems to reveal the evolutionary forces involved. Examples include isoleucyl-{tRNA} synthetases whose acquisition from eukaryotes by several bacteria is linked to antibiotic resistance, {ATP/ADP} translocases acquired by intracellular parasitic bacteria, Chlamydia and Rickettsia, apparently from plants, and proteases that may be implicated in chlamydial pathogenesis.},

The ensemble method automatically selects a subset of most informative genes and builds a quantitatively better model for them. Genes which cluster together in the majority of models produce functionally more coherent modules. Regulators which are consistently assigned to a module are more often supported by literature, but a single model always contains many regulator assignments not supported by the ensemble.

Recent boost in whole-genome sequencing, array-based allelic variation mapping, and genome-wide transcriptional profiling have unprecedentedly advanced knowledge on cell biology and evolution of this organism. It is now possible to investigate how evolution shapes the functional architecture of yeast genomes and how this architecture relates to the evolution of the regulatory networks controlling the expression of genes that make up an organism. A survey of the information on genetic and whole-genome expression variations in yeast populations shows that a significant score of gene expression variation is dependent on genotype-by-environment interaction. In some cases, large trans effects are the result of mutations in the promoters of key master regulator genes. Yet trans-variation in environmental sensor proteins appears to explain the majority of the expression patterns differentiating strains in natural populations. The challenge is now to use this information to model how individual genetic polymorphisms interact in a condition-dependent fashion to produce phenotypic change. In this study, we show how fruitful application of systems biology to the progress of science and medicine requires the use of evolution as a lens to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of regulation of biological systems. The lessons learned in yeast can be of paramount importance in advancing the application of genomics and systems biology to emerging fields including personalized medicine.

Antibiotic resistance occurs not only by mutation of microbial genes which code for antibiotic uptake into cells or the binding sites for antibiotics, but mostly by the acquisition of heterologous resistance genes from external sources. The physical characteristics of the microbial community play a major role in gene exchange, but antimicrobial agents provide the selective pressure for the development of resistance and promote the transfer of resistance genes among bacteria. The control of antibiotic usage is essential to prevent the development of resistance to new antibiotics.},

We recently described the distribution of complement receptor 3 ({CR3)} on epithelia of the female genital tract. Our studies further indicate that {CR3-mediated} endocytosis serves as a primary mechanism by which N. gonorrhoeae elicits membrane ruffling and cellular invasion of primary, human, cervical epithelial cells. We have extended these studies to describe the nature of the gonococcus-{CR3} interaction. Western Blot analysis demonstrated production of alternative pathway complement components by ecto- and endocervical cells which allows C3b deposition on gonococci and its rapid conversion to {iC3b.} Anti-{iC3b} and -factor I antibodies significantly inhibited adherence and invasion of primary cervical cells, suggesting that {iC3b} covalently bound to the gonococcus serves as a primary ligand for {CR3} adherence. However, gonococcal porin and pili also bound to the I-domain of {CR3} in a non-opsonic manner. Binding of porin and pili to {CR3} were required for adherence to and invasion of cervical epithelia. Collectively, these data suggest that gonococcal adherence to {CR3} occurs in a co-operative manner, which requires gonococcal {iC3b-opsonization}, porin and pilus. In conjunction, these molecules facilitate targeting to and successful infection of the cervical epithelium.},

In analogy to classical Pavlovian conditioning, microorganisms may have evolved to anticipate environmental stimuli by adapting to their temporal order of appearance. Here we present evidence for environmental change anticipation in two model microorganisms, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that anticipation is an adaptive trait, because pre-exposure to the stimulus that typically appears early in the ecology improves the organism's fitness when encountered with a second stimulus. Additionally, we observe loss of the conditioned response in E. coli strains that were repeatedly exposed in a laboratory evolution experiment only to the first stimulus. Focusing on the molecular level reveals that the natural temporal order of stimuli is embedded in the wiring of the regulatory network-early stimuli pre-induce genes that would be needed for later ones, yet later stimuli only induce genes needed to cope with them. Our work indicates that environmental anticipation is an adaptive trait that was repeatedly selected for during evolution and thus may be ubiquitous in biology.},

	abstract = {We investigate the conservation of amino acid residue sequences in 21 {DNA-binding} protein families and study the effects that mutations have on {DNA-sequence} recognition. The observations are best understood by assigning each protein family to one of three classes: (i) non-specific, where binding is independent of {DNA} sequence; (ii) highly specific, where binding is specific and all members of the family target the same {DNA} sequence; and (iii) multi-specific, where binding is also specific, but individual family members target different {DNA} sequences. Overall, protein residues in contact with the {DNA} are better conserved than the rest of the protein surface, but there is a complex underlying trend of conservation for individual residue positions. Amino acid residues that interact with the {DNA} backbone are well conserved across all protein families and provide a core of stabilising contacts for homologous protein-{DNA} complexes. In contrast, amino acid residues that interact with {DNA} bases have variable levels of conservation depending on the family classification. In non-specific families, base-contacting residues are well conserved and interactions are always found in the minor groove where there is little discrimination between base types. In highly specific families, base-contacting residues are highly conserved and allow member proteins to recognise the same target sequence. In multi-specific families, base-contacting residues undergo frequent mutations and enable different proteins to recognise distinct target sequences. Finally, we report that interactions with bases in the target sequence often follow (though not always) a universal code of amino acid-base recognition and the effects of amino acid mutations can be most easily understood for these interactions (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Darwin's finches in the Galapagos, cichlid fishes in African Rift and Nicaraguan crater lakes, and the emergence of mammals at the end of the Cretaceous are hallmark examples. Although we have learned much from these and other case studies about the mechanisms thought to drive adaptive radiations, convincing experimental tests of theory are often lacking for the simple reason that it is usually impossible to "rewind the tape of life," as Stephen Jay Gould was fond of saying, and run it again. This situation has changed dramatically in recent years with the increasing emphasis on the use of microbial populations which, because of their small size and rapid generation times, make possible the construction of replicated, manipulative experiments to study evolution in the laboratory. Here I review the contributions that microbial experimental evolution has made to our understanding of the ecological and genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive radiation. I focus on three major gaps in the theory of adaptive radiation-the paucity of direct tests of mechanism, the genetics of diversification, and the limits and constraints on the progress of radiations-with the aim of pointing the way toward the development of a more general theory of adaptive radiation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis ({WGCNA)} can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. {RESULTS:} The {WGCNA} R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. {CONCLUSION:} The {WGCNA} package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at {http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.}},

Adaptation to extreme environments tends to shift the 'mesophilic' characteristics of proteins to the respective extremes of temperature, hydrostatic pressure, {pH} and salinity, such that, under the mutual physiological conditions, the molecular properties are similar regarding overall topology, flexibility and solvation. Enhanced intrinsic stability requires only minute local structural changes so that general strategies of stabilization cannot be established. Apart from mutative changes of amino-acid sequences, extrinsic factors (or cellular components) may be involved in 'extremophilic adaptation'. The molecular basis of acidophilic, alkalophilic and barophilic adaptation is still obscure. Mechanisms of enhanced thermal stability involve improved packing density, as well as specific local interactions. In halophiles, water and salt binding of the intrinsically stable protein inventory is accomplished by favoring acidic over basic amino acid residues and decreased hydrophobicity. General limits of viability are: (a) the susceptibility of the covalent structure of the polypeptide chain toward hydrolysis or hydrothermal degradation; (b) the competition of extreme solvent parameters with the weak electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions involved in protein stabilization; (c) perturbations of the folding and assembly of proteins; and (d) 'dislocation' of biochemical pathways due to effects of extreme conditions on the intricate network of metabolic reactions.},

Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

The temporal program in this organism enhances fitness in rhythmic environments and is truly global - essentially all genes are regulated by the circadian system. The topology of the chromosome also oscillates and possibly regulates the rhythm of gene expression. The underlying circadian mechanism appears to consist of both a post-translational oscillator ({PTO)} and a transcriptional/translational feedback loop ({TTFL).} The {PTO} can be reconstituted in vitro with three purified proteins ({KaiA}, {KaiB}, and {KaiC)} and {ATP.} These three core oscillator proteins have been crystallized and structurally determined, the only full-length circadian proteins to be so characterized. The timing of cell division is gated by a circadian checkpoint, but the circadian pacemaker is not influenced by the status of the cell division cycle. This imperturbability may be due to the presence of the {PTO} that persists under conditions in which metabolism is repressed. Recent biochemical, biophysical, and structural discoveries have brought the cyanobacterial circadian system to the brink of explaining heretofore unexplainable biochemical characteristics of a circadian oscillator: the long time constant, precision, and temperature compensation.},

Some investigators have proposed that circathan clocks provide an additional "intrinsic adaptive value," that is, the circadian clock that regulates the timing of internal events has evolved to be such an integral part of the temporal regulation that it is useful in all conditions, even in constant environments. There have been practically no rigorous tests of either of these propositions. Using cyanobacterial strains with different clock properties growing in competition with each other, we found that strains with a functioning biological clock defeat clock-disrupted strains in rhythmic environments. In contrast to the expectations of the "intrinsic value model," this competitive advantage disappears in constant environments. In addition, competition experiments using strains with different circadian periods showed that cyanobacterial strains compete most effectively in a rhythmic environment when the frequency of their internal biological oscillator and that of the environmental cycle are similar. Together, these studies demonstrate the adaptive value of circadian temporal programming in cyanobacteria but indicate that this adaptive value is only fulfilled in cyclic environments.},

This characteristic correlates with high surface negative charge, determined through homology modeling, as the major adaptive mechanism of halophilic proteins to function in nearly saturating salinity. (2) Codon usage displays the expected {GC} bias in the wobble position and is consistent with a highly acidic proteome. (3) Distinct genomic domains of {NRC-I} with bacterial character are apparent by whole proteome {BL-AST} analysis, including two gene clusters coding for a bacterial-type aerobic respiratory chain.

It was originally identified as a gene where disruptions suppressed the expression of the lactose (lac) operon, but it was rapidly realized that it had a role at a large number of other promoters. The story of the discovery of {CAP} is fascinating and has been told many times (e.g., by Pastan and Adhya,1 Ullmann and Danchin2). In the mid-sixties it had been shown that glucose repression of lac expression could be countered by the inclusion of cyclic {AMP} ({cAMP)} in the growth media. In the late sixties, mutants at two unlinked loci that suppressed lac expression were identified: the effects of the mutants at just one of the loci (at map position 85 minutes) could be suppressed by added {cAMP.} The simplest explanation was that the 85 minute mutations identified the gene encoding adenyl cyclase (cya), while the other locus, at 73 minutes, mapped a {cAMP} receptor. This triggered a rush to purify this receptor, and by the early seventies, simple in vitro systems could be used to show {cAMP-depen-dent} lac transcription. The rush also led to some confusion in nomenclature with the receptor being variously known as {CRP} (cyclic {AMP} receptor protein), {CAP} or {CGA} (catabolite gene activator protein).},

To illustrate this approach, we highlight three cases where our combined procedure has provided novel insights into our understanding of chemotaxis, possible prophage remnants in Halobacterium {NRC-1} and archaeal transcriptional {regulators.Simultaneous} analysis of the association network, coordinated {mRNA} level changes in microarray experiments and genome-wide structure prediction has allowed us to glean significant biological insights into the roles of several Halobacterium {NRC-1} proteins of previously unknown function, and significantly reduce the number of proteins encoded in the genome of this haloarchaeon for which no annotation is available.},

Here, we study the significance of clonal interference in populations Consisting of mixtures of differently marked wild-type and mutator strains of Escherichia coli that adapt to a minimal-glucose environment. for 400 generations. We monitored marker frequencies during evolution and measured the competitive fitness of random clones from each marker state after evolution. The results demonstrate the presence of multiple beneficial mutations in these populations and slower and more erratic invasion of mutants than expected by the conventional model, showing the signature of clonal interference. We found that. a consequence of clonal interference is that fitness estimates derived from invasion trajectories were less than half the magnitnde of direct estimates from Competition experiments, thus revealing fundamental problems with this fitness measure.

Through phenotypic screening, systems analysis, and rigorous experimental validation, we discovered an {RNase} ({VNG2099C)} in Halobacterium salinarum that is transcriptionally co-regulated with genes of the aerobic physiologic state but acts on transcripts of the anaerobic state. Through modelling and experimentation we show that this arrangement generates an efficient state-transition switch, within which {RNase-repression} of a transcriptional positive autoregulation ({RPAR)} loop is critical for shutting down {ATP-consuming} active potassium uptake to conserve energy required for salinity adaptation under aerobic, high potassium, or dark conditions. Subsequently, we discovered that many Escherichia coli operons with energy-associated functions are also putatively controlled by {RPAR} indicating that this network motif may have evolved independently in phylogenetically distant organisms. Thus, our data suggest that interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in the {RPAR} motif is a generalized principle for efficient environment-dependent state transitions across prokaryotes.},

Motivated by these observations, we have investigated the implications of {TFB} expansions by correlating sequence variations, regulation, and physical interactions of all seven {TFBs} in Halobacterium salinarum {NRC-1} to their fitness landscapes, functional hierarchies, and genetic interactions across 2488 experiments covering combinatorial variations in salt, {pH}, temperature, and Cu stress. This systems analysis has revealed an elegant scheme in which completely novel fitness landscapes are generated by gene conversion events that introduce subtle changes to the regulation or physical interactions of duplicated {TFBs.} Based on these insights, we have introduced a synthetically redesigned {TFB} and altered the regulation of existing {TFBs} to illustrate how archaea can rapidly generate novel phenotypes by simply reprogramming their {TFB} regulatory network.},

While molecular biologists use genetically homogeneous strains of model organisms to avoid this variation, evolutionary biologists embrace genetic variation as the material of evolution since heritable differences in fitness drive evolutionary change. Yet, the relationship between the phenotypic variation affecting fitness and the genotypic variation producing it is complex. Genetic buffering mechanisms modify this relationship by concealing the effects of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype. Genetic buffering allows the build-up and storage of genetic variation in phenotypically normal populations. When buffering breaks down, thresholds governing the expression of previously silent variation are crossed. At these thresholds, phenotypic differences suddenly appear and are available for selection. Thus, buffering mechanisms modulate evolution and regulate a balance between evolutionary stasis and change. Recent work provides a glimpse of the molecular details governing some types of genetic buffering. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

According to this model, upon oxygen influx, an initial burst of protein synthesis precedes {ATP} and transcription induction, rapidly driving the cell out of anoxic quiescence, culminating in the resumption of growth. This model also suggests that quiescent cells appear to remain actively poised for energy production from a variety of different sources. Dynamic temporal analysis of relationships between transcription and translation of key genes suggests several important mechanisms for cellular sustenance under anoxia as well as specific instances of post-transcriptional regulation.},

Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a moderate halophile, having an absolute requirement for salt for survival, and is capable of growth at 1 to 9\% {NaCl.} It is the leading cause of seafood-related bacterial gastroenteritis in the United States and much of Asia. We determined whether growth in differing {NaCl} concentrations alters the susceptibility of V. parahaemolyticus {O3:K6} to other environmental stresses. Vibrio parahaemolyticus was grown at a 1\% or 3\% {NaCl} concentration, and the growth and survival of the organism were examined under acid or temperature stress conditions. Growth of V. parahaemolyticus in 3\% {NaCl} versus that in 1\% {NaCl} increased survival under both inorganic ({HCl)} and organic (acetic acid) acid conditions. In addition, at 42 degrees C and -20 degrees C, 1\% {NaCl} had a detrimental effect on growth. The expression of lysine decarboxylase (encoded by {cadA)}, the organism's main acid stress response system, was induced by both {NaCl} and acid conditions. To begin to address the mechanism of regulation of the stress response, we constructed a knockout mutation in {rpoS}, which encodes the alternative stress sigma factor, and in {toxRS}, a two-component regulator common to many Vibrio species. Both mutant strains had significantly reduced survival under acid stress conditions. The effect of V. parahaemolyticus growth in 1\% or 3\% {NaCl} was examined using a cytotoxicity assay, and we found that V. parahaemolyticus grown in 1\% {NaCl} was significantly more toxic than that grown in 3\% {NaCl.}},

Classifying the regulated genes into three functional categories of transport, biosynthesis and metabolism leads to the elucidation of regulatory motifs that constitute the integrated network's basic building blocks. The regulatory logic of these motifs was determined on the basis of relationships between transcription factor binding and changes in the amount of transcript in response to exogenous amino acids. Remarkably, the resulting logic shows how amino acids are differentiated as signaling and nutrient molecules, revealing the overarching regulatory principles of the amino acid stimulon.},

These simulations demonstrate that rapid or dramatic environmental change leads to selection for greater evolvability. The selective pressure for large-scale genetic moves such as {DNA} exchange becomes increasingly strong as the environmental conditions become more uncertain. Our results demonstrate that evolvability is a selectable trait and allow for the explanation of a large body of experimental results.},

After library selection, changes in frequency of each insertion mutant are determined by sequencing the flanking regions en masse. These changes are used to calculate each mutant's fitness. Using this approach, we determined fitness for each gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a causative agent of pneumonia and meningitis. A genome-wide screen for genetic interactions of five query genes identified both alleviating and aggravating interactions that could be divided into seven distinct categories. Owing to the wide activity of the Mariner transposon, Tn-seq has the potential to contribute to the exploration of complex pathways across many different species.},

	abstract = {Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop ({FFL).} The {FFL}, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The {FFL} has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the {FFL} can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the {FFL} types, termed incoherent {FFLs}, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent {FFLs}, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some {FFL} types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare {FFL} types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.},

	abstract = {It is widely suspected that gene regulatory networks are highly plastic. The rapid turnover of transcription factor binding sites has been predicted on theoretical grounds and has been experimentally demonstrated in closely related species. We combined experimental approaches with comparative genomics to focus on the role of combinatorial control in the evolution of a large transcriptional circuit in the fungal lineage. Our study centers on Mcm1, a transcriptional regulator that, in combination with five cofactors, binds roughly 4\% of the genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and regulates processes ranging from the cell-cycle to mating. In Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida albicans, two other hemiascomycetes, we find that the Mcm1 combinatorial circuits are substantially different. This massive rewiring of the Mcm1 circuitry has involved both substantial gain and loss of targets in ancient combinatorial circuits as well as the formation of new combinatorial interactions. We have dissected the gains and losses on the global level into subsets of functionally and temporally related changes. One particularly dramatic change is the acquisition of Mcm1 binding sites in close proximity to Rap1 binding sites at 70 ribosomal protein genes in the K. lactis lineage. Another intriguing and very recent gain occurs in the C. albicans lineage, where Mcm1 is found to bind in combination with the regulator Wor1 at many genes that function in processes associated with adaptation to the human host, including the white-opaque epigenetic switch. The large turnover of Mcm1 binding sites and the evolution of new Mcm1-cofactor interactions illuminate in sharp detail the rapid evolution of combinatorial transcription networks.},

Stochastic fluctuations in the cellular components that determine cellular states can cause two distinct subpopulations, a property called bistability Phenotypic heterogeneity can be readily obtained by interlinking multiple gene regulatory pathways, effectively resulting in a genetic logic-{ANTI} gate. Although switching between states can occur within the cells' lifetime, cells can also pass their cellular state over to the next generation by a mechanism known as epigenetic inheritance and thus perpetuate the phenotypic state. Importantly, heterogeneous populations can demonstrate increased fitness compared with homogeneous populations. This suggests that microbial cells employ bet-hedging strategies to maximize survival. Here, we discuss the possible roles of interlinked bistable networks, epigenetic inheritance, and bet-hedging in bacteria.},

A mathematical analysis revealed that a two-component genetic circuit with elements of opposite regulatory activity (activator and inhibitor) constitutes a minimal requirement for network-dosage invariance. Specific interaction topologies and a one-to-one interaction stoichiometry between the activating and inhibiting agents were additional essential elements facilitating dosage invariance.

We instead propose that most genes are under indirect control: their expression responds to signal(s) that are not directly related to the genes' function. Indirect control should perform poorly in artificial conditions, and we show that gene regulation is often maladaptive in the laboratory. In Shewanella oneidensis {MR-1}, 24\% of genes are detrimental to fitness in some conditions, and detrimental genes tend to be highly expressed instead of being repressed when not needed. In diverse bacteria, there is little correlation between when genes are important for optimal growth or fitness and when those genes are upregulated. Two common types of indirect control are constitutive expression and regulation by growth rate; these occur for genes with diverse functions and often seem to be suboptimal. Because genes that have closely related functions can have dissimilar expression patterns, regulation may be suboptimal in the wild as well as in the laboratory.},

This test uses a statistical model to describe multiplicative and additive errors influencing an array experiment, where model parameters are estimated from observed intensities for all genes using the method of maximum likelihood. A generalized likelihood ratio test is performed for each gene to determine whether, under the model, these intensities are significantly different. We use this method to identify significant differences in gene expression among yeast cells growing in galactose-stimulating versus non-stimulating conditions and compare our results with current approaches for identifying differentially-expressed genes.

However, regulatory mechanisms that establish homeostasis are not well understood in organisms that dwell in environments at the extremes of {pH}, temperature, and salinity. Under conditions of limited iron, the extremophile Halobacterium salinarum, a salt-loving archaeon, mounts a specific response to scavenge iron for growth. We have identified and characterized the role of two transcription factors ({TFs)}, Idr1 and Idr2, in regulating this important response. An integrated systems analysis of {TF} knockout gene expression profiles and genome-wide binding locations in the presence and absence of iron has revealed that these {TFs} operate collaboratively to maintain iron homeostasis. In the presence of iron, Idr1 and Idr2 bind near each other at 24 loci in the genome, where they are both required to repress some genes. By contrast, Idr1 and Idr2 are both necessary to activate other genes in a putative a feed forward loop. Even at loci bound independently, the two {TFs} target different genes with similar functions in iron homeostasis. We discuss conserved and unique features of the Idr1-Idr2 system in the context of similar systems in organisms from other domains of life.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in biology is how the cell uses transcription factors ({TFs)} to coordinate the expression of thousands of genes in response to various stimuli. The relationships between {TFs} and their target genes can be modeled in terms of directed regulatory networks. These relationships, in turn, can be readily compared with commonplace "chain-of-command" structures in social networks, which have characteristic hierarchical layouts. Here, we develop algorithms for identifying generalized hierarchies (allowing for various loop structures) and use these approaches to illuminate extensive pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures existing in the regulatory networks of representative prokaryotes (Escherichia coit) and eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with most {TFs} at the bottom levels and only a few master {TFs} on top. These masters are situated near the center of the protein-protein interaction network, a different type of network from the regulatory one, and they receive most of the input for the whole regulatory hierarchy through protein interactions. Moreover, they have maximal influence over other genes, in terms of affecting expression-level changes. Surprisingly, however, {TFs} at the bottom of the regulatory hierarchy are more essential to the viability of the cell. Finally, one might think master {TFs} achieve their wide influence through directly regulating many targets, but {TFs} with most direct targets are in the middle of the hierarchy. We find, in fact, that these midlevel {TFs} are "control bottlenecks" in the hierarchy, and this great degree of control for "middle managers" has parallels in efficient social structures in various corporate and governmental settings.},

While evolving technologies for global profiling of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites are making it possible to comprehensively survey cellular physiology in newly sequenced organisms, these experimental techniques have not kept pace with sequencing efforts. Compounding these technological challenges is the fact that individual experiments typically only stimulate relatively small-scale cellular responses, thus requiring numerous expensive experiments to survey the operational relationships among nearly all genetic elements. Therefore, a relatively quick and inexpensive strategy for observing changes in large fractions of the genetic elements is highly {desirable.We} have discovered in the model organism Halobacterium salinarum {NRC-1} that batch culturing in complex medium stimulates meaningful changes in the expression of approximately two thirds of all genes. While the majority of these changes occur during transition from rapid exponential growth to the stationary phase, several transient physiological states were detected beyond what has been previously observed. In sum, integrated analysis of transcript and metabolite changes has helped uncover growth phase-associated physiologies, operational interrelationships among two thirds of all genes, specialized functions for gene family members, waves of transcription factor activities, and growth phase associated cell morphology {control.Simple} laboratory culturing in complex medium can be enormously informative regarding the activities of and interrelationships among a large fraction of all genes in an organism. This also yields important baseline physiological context for designing specific perturbation experiments at different phases of growth.

Despite a loose correlation between codon assignments and {AARS} evolutionary relationships, the code is fnr too highly structured to have been ordered merely through the evolutionary wanderings of these enzymes. Nevertheless, the {AARSs} are very informative about the evolutionary process. Examination of the phylogenetic trees for each of the {AARSs} reveals the following. (i) Their evolutionary relationships mostly conform to established organismal phylogeny: a strong distinction exists between bacterial- and archaeal-type {AARSs.} (ii) Although the evolutionary profiles of the individual {AARSs} might be expected to be similar in general respects, they are not. It is argued that these differences in profiles reflect the stages in the evolutionary process when the taxonomic distributions of the individual {AARSs} became fixed not the nature of the individual enzymes. (iii) Horizontal transfer of {AARS} genes between Bacteria and Archaea is asymmetric: transfer of archaeal {AARSs} to the Bacteria is more prevalent than the reverse, which is seen only for the "gemini group."

While fitness costs have been demonstrated for bacteria and viruses resistant to some chemotherapeutic agents, these costs are anticipated to decline during subsequent evolution. This has recently been observed in pathogens as diverse as {HIV} and Escherichia coli. Here we present evidence that these genetic adaptations to the costs of resistance can virtually preclude resistant lineages from reverting to sensitivity. We show that second site mutations which compensate for the substantial (14 and 18\% per generation) fitness costs of streptomycin resistant ({rpsL)} mutations in E. coli create a genetic background in which streptomycin sensitive, {rpsL(+)} alleles have a 4-30\% per generation selective disadvantage relative to adapted, resistant strains. We also present evidence that similar compensatory mutations have been fixed in long-term streptomycin-resistant laboratory strains of E. coli and may account for the persistence of {rpsL} streptomycin resistance in populations maintained for more than 10 000 generations in the absence of the antibiotic. We discuss the public health implications of these and other experimental results that question whether the more prudent use of antimicrobial chemotherapy will lead to declines in the incidence of drug-resistant pathogenic microbes.},

This anticipatory behavior is important to the fitness of diverse species, and in context of the diurnal cycle it is overall typical of eukaryotes and some photoautotrophic bacteria but is yet to be observed in archaea. Here, we report the first observation of light-dark ({LD)-entrained} diurnal oscillatory transcription in up to 12\% of all genes of a halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum {NRC-1.} Significantly, the diurnally entrained transcription was observed under constant darkness after removal of the {LD} stimulus (free-running rhythms). The memory of diurnal entrainment was also associated with the synchronization of oxic and anoxic physiologies to the {LD} cycle. Our results suggest that under nutrient limited conditions halophilic archaea take advantage of the causal influence of sunlight (via temperature) on O(2) diffusivity in a closed hypersaline environment to streamline their physiology and operate oxically during nighttime and anoxically during daytime.},

	abstract = {Comparative analysis of genome sequence data from mesophilic and hyperthermophilic micro-organisms has revealed a strong bias against specific thermolabile aminoacid residues (i.e. N and Q) in hyperthermophilic proteins. The N + Q content of class {II} xylose isomerases ({XIs)} from mesophiles, moderate thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles was examined. It was found to correlate inversely with the growth temperature of the source organism in all cases examined, except for the previously uncharacterized {XI} from Bacillus licheniformis {DSM13} ({BLXI)}, which had an N + Q content comparable to that of homologs from much more thermophilic sources. To determine whether {BLXI} behaves as a thermostable enzyme, it was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the thermostability and activity properties of the recombinant enzyme were studied. Indeed, it was optimally active at 70-72 {degreesC}, which is significantly higher than the optimal growth temperature (37 {degreesC)} of B. licheniformis. The kinetic properties of {BLXI}, determined at 60 {degreesC} with glucose and xylose as substrates, were comparable to those of other class {II} {XIs.} The stability of {BLXI} was dependent on the metallic cation present in its two metal-binding sites. The enzyme thermostability increased in the order apoenzyme {\textbackslash}textless Mg2+-enzyme {\textbackslash}textless Co2+-enzyme = Mn2+-enzyme, with melting temperatures of 50.3 {degreesC}, 53.3 {degreesC}, 73.4 {degreesC}, and 73.6 {degreesC.} {BLXI} inactivation was first-order in all conditions examined. The energy of activation for irreversible inactivation was also strongly influenced by the metal present, ranging from 342 {kJ.mol(-1)} (apoenzyme) to 604 {kJ.mol(-1)} (Mg2+-enzyme) to 1166 {kJ.mol(-1)} (Co2+-enzyme). These results suggest that the first irreversible event in {BLXI} unfolding is the release of one or both of its metals from the active site. Although N + Q content was an indicator of thermostability for class {II} {XIs}, this pattern may not hold for other sets of homologous enzymes. In fact, the extremely thermostable a-amylase from B. licheniformis was found to have an average N + Q content compared with homologous enzymes from a variety of mesophilic and thermophilic sources. Thus, it would appear that protein thermostability is a function of more complex molecular determinants than amino-acid content alone.},

The elucidation of transcriptional regulatory networks is thus needed to understand the cell's working mechanism, and can for example, be useful for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Although several methods have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data, a recent comparison on a large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most current methods only predict a limited number of known regulations at a reasonable precision level. Results: We propose {SIRENE} (Supervised Inference of Regulatory Networks), a new method for the inference of gene regulatory networks from a compendium of expression data. The method decomposes the problem of gene regulatory network inference into a large number of local binary classification problems, that focus on separating target genes from non-targets for each transcription factor. {SIRENE} is thus conceptually simple and computationally efficient. We test it on a benchmark experiment aimed at predicting regulations in Escherichia coli, and show that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more known regulations than other state-of-the-art inference methods.

Globally optimal generalization performance can be obtained by choosing the training set sizes of the students optimally. For smaller ensembles, optimization of the ensemble weights can yield significant improvements in ensemble generalization performance, in particular if the individual students are subject to noise in the training process. Choosing students with a wide range of regularization parameters makes this improvement robust against changes in the unknown level of corruption of the training data.},
